# JIRA Search Extension README

This is a simple extension that allows you to search your JIRA issues assigned to you.
Possibly in the future I will add other search/queries you can perform. 


## Features

The only command is "Jira Search My Issues"

> Tip: The list that shows when you execute the command can be filtered as you type.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `jiraSearch.url`: the base url for your jira site (ex. "http://mysite.jira.com")
* `jiraSearch.username`: username for your jira account (typically not the email address)
* `jiraSearch.password`: password for your jira account

## Known Issues

Can only point to one JIRA site so if you use multiple JIRA issues this is currently not supported.
